# SundogCoffeRoastingCo

The requirements for the this capstone project were:

Must have at least one Directive    
Must fetch data from a service (i.e. API)   
Must use Routing  
Must have at least one instance of Pipes 
Must have a minimum of two Components
Must have custom unit tests for each component
The app must load within 5 seconds on a standard high-speed internet connection
Must utilize Bootstrap 3.0 or 4.0
Must use at least one SASS variable  
Must have at least 1 form with basic validation 
Must have a universal navigation menu to easily navigate the app

Within these requirements, I built a mock company called Sundog Coffee Roasting and created a website. To fulfill the form requirement, I wrote a coffee quiz where you can fill in your favorite coffee flavor profile, how you like it roasted, and what you use to brew it.
